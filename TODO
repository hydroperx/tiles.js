Refactor:

- [ ] Layouts: adding, removing, resizing or moving tiles should influence in the offset XYrem coordinates of the next groups (including their labels and tiles).
- [ ] Grid snapping: note that `client_x_to_x` or `client_y_to_y` may return an `""` (empty) group. In case of horizontal containers, to-y will always give empty group; while in vertical containers, to-x will always give empty group.
- [ ] Grid snapping: note that `client_x_to_x` or `client_y_to_y` may return an empty group in case they create a last group (depends on the container direction).
- [ ] Remove a group after all attached tiles are removed from it.

Misc:

- [ ] Control the cascading `transition`
  - [ ] of labels
  - [ ] and tiles
- [ ] Drag-n-drop
- [ ] Do not set/use `data-group`, `data-size`, `data-horizontal` and `data-vertical` at tiles.
- [ ] Dispose of tile draggables in `destroy()`

# Changes

- FullTilesPositionMap
  - [ ] FullTilesPositionMap's constructor is now replaced by `populate_tiles()`
  - [ ] `setPosition` is now `set_real_position`
  - [ ] `contributeTile` is now `contribute_calc_tile`

# Vertical containers

- [ ] `put_label` must additionally increase `this.m_group_y` by `this.m_group_label_height * this.m_rem`
