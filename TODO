# Representation

- [x] Groups have `position: absolute`
- [x] GroupTiles have `position: relative`
- [x] Groups contain groupLabel and groupTiles
- [x] Tiles are `button` elements (of `position: absolute`) containing a tile content element. During dragging, the user may slightly scale down tile contents rather than the tile's button itself.

# Zoom

- [ ] Near view and far view modes. Vertical container is always in near view.
- [ ] When in far view, user is not allowed to interact with tiles, but rather with groups, allowing to drag-n-drop groups.
