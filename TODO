Bugs:

- [ ] Dragging tiles isn't working properly for example when you drag a tile far away in a new anonymous group and drag it again (for some reason groups move/enlargen, and that is not a "shifting" issue as I've debugged it for that).
- [ ] Shifting tiles can happen resulting in tile positions greater than expected.
- [ ] An error may occur when grid snapping or shifting tiles due to some tile being removed from group (therefore its respective group is yielding `undefined`).
  - This is apparently happening due to `shift()`. Fix `HorizontalLayout#shift()`?

Other:

- [ ] Remove a group after all attached tiles are removed from it.
- [ ] Control the cascading `transition`
  - [ ] of labels
  - [ ] and tiles
- [ ] Do not set/use `data-group`, `data-size`, `data-horizontal` and `data-vertical` at tiles.

# Changes

- FullTilesPositionMap
  - [ ] FullTilesPositionMap's constructor is now replaced by `populate_tiles()`
  - [ ] `setPosition` is now `set_real_position`
  - [ ] `contributeTile` is now `contribute_calc_tile`

# Vertical containers

- [ ] `put_label` must additionally increase `this.m_group_y` by `this.m_group_label_height * this.m_rem`
