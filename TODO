Bugs:

- [ ] Grid snapping, when going far away in a new auto group, and the first following grid snap does not work, but the second and so on do work.
- [ ] Shifting tiles not working perfectly.

Other:

- [ ] Control the cascading `transition`
  - [ ] of labels
  - [ ] and tiles
- [ ] Do not set/use `data-group`, `data-size`, `data-horizontal` and `data-vertical` at tiles.

# Vertical containers

- [ ] `put_label` must additionally increase `this.m_group_y` by `this.m_group_label_height * this.m_rem`
