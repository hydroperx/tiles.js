Bugs:

- [ ] Grid snapping not working at all far away in an auto group, in case an initial far away grid snap occurred in an auto group already. I think this happening because groups are being automatically removed and the previous groups turn "empty" after a grid snap.
- [ ] Shifting tiles not working perfectly.

Other:
 
- [ ] Control the cascading `transition` (to feel more like Windows 8)
  - [ ] of labels
  - [ ] and tiles
