# Tiles container

- [ ] Horizontal: width is infinite and groups are stacked horizontally; prefer to contribute tiles at vertical end.
- [ ] Vertical: width is fixed and may increase up to 3 times itself; prefer to contribute tiles at horizontal end.
- [ ] Representation: the Tiles container contains a groups container. The placeholder being dragged appears as a direct child of the Tiles container with a fixed position.

# Scrolling

- [ ] Smooth, fast scrolling with mouse wheel

# While dragging

- [ ] In a horizontal container, if dragging tile far orthogonal axis, then scale tiles down.

# Zoom

- [ ] Near view and far view modes. Vertical container is always in near view.
- [ ] Allow to zoom in/out switching between near/far view in a horizontal container, either through <kbd>Ctrl + Plus</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl + Minus</kbd> or pinch gesture.
- [ ] When in far view, user is not allowed to interact with tiles, but rather with groups, allowing to drag-n-drop groups.

# Tile, content representation

- [ ] Tiles are `button` elements containing a tile content element. During dragging, tile contents are slightly scaled down rather than the tile's button itself.
