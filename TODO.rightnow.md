- [ ] Reimplement BaseLayout.ts based on my Google Drive > Live tiles > note
- [ ] Somehow group labels bug such that they are not clickable for edit anymore. That happens particularly after dragging the group.
- [ ] Make it so groupLabel has same width as tilesDiv and ensure overflow is hidden
- [ ] Group labels not editable in mobile
- [ ] groupLabelEditable? option
- [ ] Fix tiles tweening X/Y simultaneously
- [ ] Remove groupTilesDiv overflow hidden and apply a clipping mask only while tweening tiles
