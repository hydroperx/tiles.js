# Drag start

- [x] Disable `.style.pointerEvents = "none";` for the entire Tiles container.
- [x] Set `.style.pointerEvents = "auto";` for the tile's button itself.
- [x] Set `.style.zIndex = "999999999";` for the tile's button.
- [x] Save drag start (offset, old state and layoutIndex)
- [x] While the tile is being dragged, it is moved out of the group div temporarily and appears a direct child of the Tiles container.
- [x] Remove the tile from the layout.
- [ ] Reset ghost tile caches
- [ ] Reset grid snap caches
- [ ] Set the `ATTR_DRAGGING` attribute to `"true"`.
- [ ] Trigger Tiles drag start event

# Drag move

- [x] If the tile is removed while dragging
  - [x] Exit
- [x] Patch the draggable position using `draggable.set(x, y)`
- [ ] In a horizontal container, if dragging tile far orthogonal axis, then switch to far view.
  - [ ] After that, if dragging the tile back to the center, switch back to near view and scroll smoothly to the closest group (look at the Tiles container's nearest horizontally-scrollable parent).
- [ ] Grid snap
  - [ ] Copy the logic for grid snapping from the previous version for determining at which group and X/Y a tile is dragging/dropping over. Cache the grid snap result.
  - [ ] If grid snap resolves successfully to an existing area
    - [ ] If ghost tile has already been created
      - [ ] Require a X/Y change threshold (of 2 small tiles) to continue procedures from here on
      - [ ] Execute the procedure below for *Reverting a ghost tile*
    - [ ] Insert a ghost tile without button at the layout
    - [ ] Suggest a strong-strength value for the X/Y of that ghost tile
    - [ ] `.refreshNonOverlappingConstraints()`
    - [ ] `._deferred_rearrange()`
  - [ ] Else
    - [ ] If ghost tile has been created
      - [ ] Execute the procedure below for *Reverting a ghost tile*
      - [ ] `.refreshNonOverlappingConstraints()`
      - [ ] `._deferred_rearrange()`
- [ ] Trigger Tiles drag event (regardless of ghost X/Y threshold)

*Reverting a ghost tile*

- [ ] Remove it from the layout
- [ ] Recreate the Cassowary solver for the respective group
- [ ] Call `.refreshMinConstraints()` and `.refreshMaxConstraints()` for every tile in the layout group
- [ ] Update every tile to reflect the old state, keeping any other new tiles as they are (e.g. reflecting the current state).
  - [ ] If the tile to restore has no DOM button, ignore it completely from the procedure.
  - [ ] Use weak-suggestions for each tile's X/Y.

  - [ ] Clear constraints from the specified tile.

  - [ ] Move the tile to the new group's tilesDiv DOM.
  - [ ] Set `button.style.inset = "";`.
  - [ ] Set X/Y state
  - [ ] Set the tile state's group field.
  - [ ] Call `.refreshMinConstraints()` and `.refreshMaxConstraints()` for every tile in the group
  - [ ] For each other tile in the layout group
    - [ ] Suggest X/Y weakly reflecting the current state.
  - [ ] Suggest X/Y weakly for the layout tile
  - [ ] `.refreshNonOverlappingConstraints()` in the group
  - [ ] If the previous group is empty, remove it (from state/layout/DOM).
  - [ ] Call `._keep_groups_contiguous()`
  - [ ] `._deferred_rearrange()`
  - [ ] `._deferred_state_update_signal()`
- [ ] Else if grid snap resolves successfully to a blank area
  - [ ] Let group = grid snap's target group
  - [ ] If group is falsy
    - [ ] group = anonymous auto-generated ID
    - [ ] Create new group `group`
  - [ ] Put the tile in the new layout group
  - [ ] Put the tile at the new group's tilesDiv DOM.
  - [ ] Set `button.style.inset = "";`.
  - [ ] Set the tile state's group field.

  - [ ] `._deferred_rearrange()`
  - [ ] `._deferred_state_update_signal()`
- [ ] Else
  - [ ] Move the tile to the DOM back in the group it was.
  - [ ] Put the tile back at the initial respective layout group (at the initial index it was (`drag_start.layoutIndex`)).
  - [ ] Set `button.style.inset = "";`.
  - [ ] If there is a ghost tile
    - [ ] Execute the procedure above for *Reverting a ghost tile*
  - [ ] Else
    - [ ] Recreate the Cassowary solver for the respective group
    - [ ] Call `.refreshMinConstraints()` and `.refreshMaxConstraints()` for every tile in the group
    - [ ] Update every tile to reflect the old state, keeping any other new tiles as they are (e.g. reflecting the current state).
